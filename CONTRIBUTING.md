Hi! :wave: Welcome and thank you for your interest in `apex-starter-pack`! I am excited to see what you have to contribute.

A couple of guidelines:

-   **Getting Started**: Please refer to the README's [installation](README.md/#installation) section for directions.
-   **Bug Reports** are tracked in [Github Issues](https://github.com/jasonsiders/apex-starter-pack/issues). Tag your issue with the `bug` label. Be sure to be as descriptive as possible, and provide the exact steps for reproducing the problem.
-   **Enhancement Requests** are also tracked in [Github Issues](https://github.com/jasonsiders/apex-starter-pack/issues). Tag your issue with the `enhancement` label. If you wish, you may open a **Pull Request** with the proposed changes.
-   **Pull Requests**: Any changes to production code should include corresponding tests. This excludes performance enhancements if they can be reasonably covered by an existing test. Before submitting your PR, ensure that all tests are passing, and that each class has 100% code coverage. You can run all tests with this command: `sfdx force:apex:test:run -r human -c`
-   **Commit Messages**: Keep these as descriptive as possible. Admittedly, I didn't do a great job of this when building the first iteration. I promise I'll change that going forward :grinning:
